<!-- NOTE
      - < > - These are tags
      - <b> This is a test </b> - This whole statement is an element (<, content, and then >)
      - <p style="color:red;" - style is the attribute. "color" is the attribute. "red" is the value.
      - Another example. You will learn this later on. <input type="text" /> -

        <input type="text" /> in its entirety is called an ELEMENT
        <input> is a TAG
        type is an ATTRIBUTE
        "text" is the VALUE

      -> HTML defines the content of web pages.

      CSS specifies the layout of web pages.

      JavaScript programs the behavior of web pages.
