<!-- All the information on this page relates to Metadata. You can skip this part for now if your starting out. -->

<!-- Metadata is used to help search engines understand your web content better. When a user searches for something, web browsers
     utilize metadata to show relavant search results to the user. Metadata is also used in search engines and other web services. -->
     
<!-- There are a lot of attributes that go along with the meta tag. Meta tags are better suited in the <head> tag at the top of your
     HTML document. -->

<!-- Metadata is not shown on your webpage to the user. It stays hidden behind the scenes. Note that anyone can view the
     source code of your webpage and will see the metadata information there. -->

<!-- lang stands for "Language". Defines the language your content is in. -->
<!-- dir stands for "Direction". Describes what direction your content flows in. (ltr is "left to right"). -->
<html lang="en-CA" dir="ltr">
  <head>

    <!-- Charset describes the characters that the webpage is utilizing. It determines how text is stored and transmitted. -->
    <meta charset="UTF-8"/>

    <!-- Base specifies the base URL to use for all relative URLs in a document. There can only be one base URL.

         These are examples of what the target attribute can do:
           - _self         - Opens in the same window as it was clicked
           - _blank        - Opens in a new window or tab
           - _parent       - Opens in the parent frame
           - _top          - Opens in the full body of the window
           - [URL]         - Can open a URL in an IFrame
    -->
    <base href="" target="_blank" />

    <!-- Viewport sets how the webpage should be displayed to the user. This is essential when you need the website to appear
         on several different device sizes. Content here describes how the webpage should look. -->
