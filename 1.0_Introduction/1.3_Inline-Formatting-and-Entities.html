      #sizeUp {
        font-size: 35px;
      }
    </style> <!-- The reason we don't use this method is because of large scale webpages. They require massive amounts of HTML and CSS. Mixing the
    two up is a recipe for a disaster. It makes them both extremely difficult to code and debug in. Plus, it's much more organized within seperate files. -->

  <!-- Also beware! Everything below (minus the use of the Entities) is taboo in HTML coding. Inline formatting is frowned upon, as it is always reserved for
       CSS files to handle. You wouldn't place HTML code in a CSS file, and so the opposite applies here -->
  <body style="background-color:gray">
    <pre> Anything

          the
     same way.

    <p>This is a <b>test</b> to <i>demonstrate</i> how <u>formatting text</u> works.</p>
    <p><strong>This makes the text bold.</strong></p>
    <p><em>This makes the text italicized</em></p>
    <p>(Yes, both <b>"&#60;b&#62;"</b> and <i>"&lti&gt"</i> work the same as <strong>"&ltstrong&gt"</strong> and <em>"&ltem&gt"</em>)</p>
    <p>If you wish to <mark>highlight something important.</mark></p>
    <p>Here you can <del>strikeflu</del> strikethrough text.</p>
    <p><small>As you can tell, this text is small.</small></p>
    <p>My favourite colour is <del>blue</del> <ins>green</ins>
    <p>Math problem 1: 2<sup>2</sup> = 4.</p>
    <p>Math problem 2: log<sub>10</sub> = 1</p>
    <p>Diacritical Mark: a&#770;</p>

<!-- NOTES
      - Reserved characters in HTML must be replaced with character entities. It is best practice to use entity numbers versus using entity abbreviations.

      - Eg. &lt represents < (a less-than symbol "lt"). It can also be written as &#60; (<< REMEMBER TO PLACE A SEMI-COLON (;) IF YOU ARE DOING IT THIS WAY)

      - You can also combine diacritical marks with letters (line 26)

      - Emojii's can also be used!
