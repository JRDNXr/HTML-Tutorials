<!-- NOTES
      - The method attribute uses both of the HTTP transactions "post" and "get".
      - GET requests information (usually viewing something) from the server. Nothing is changed, and is displayed as is.
      - POST is used for securely changing something (eg. password) and submits information to the server
      - DO NOT USE GET TO CHANGE SENSITIVE INFORMATION LIKE PASSWORDS. THIS INFORMATION CAN BE VIEWED EASILY IN URL'S

      - Enctype:
        - application/x-www-form-urlencoded 	Default. All characters are encoded before sent (spaces are converted to "+" symbols, and
                                              special characters are converted to ASCII HEX values)
        - multipart/form-data 	              This value is necessary if the user will upload a file through the form
        - text/plain 	                        Sends data without any encoding at all. Not recommended
-->

<!--
    - ATT: action         - Defines the action to be performed when the form is submitted.
    - ATT: method         - Specifies the HTTP method to be used when submitting the form data.
    - ATT: autocomplete   - Will complete values based on previous values the user has entered before.
    - ATT: novalidate     - Boolean. When present, it specifies that the form data SHOULD NOT be validated. Omit this part if you need the form to be validated.
    - ATT: enctype        - Specifies how the form-data should be encoded when submitting it to the server.
    - ATT: accept-charset - Specifies the character encodings that are to be used for the form submission.
